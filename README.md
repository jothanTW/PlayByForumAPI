# The Play-By-Forum API (Under NodeJS)

This is a REST backend for the Play-By-Forum framework. It's written in NodeJS, and therefore requires npm to run. It should normally be attached to a database, but right now it only delivers test data and ignores parameters.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Open the server
```
node index.html
```
